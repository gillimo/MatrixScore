# Source Notes (Neutralized)

This folder is a refactor workspace. Source materials were copied in to preserve
core scoring logic and performance characteristics. All domain-specific content
has been removed or replaced with neutral terminology. Keep this file as a
lightweight note until the refactor is complete, then delete it.
